## Introduction
The `content` repository is a platform where technical writers can contribute articles to Daytona Dotfiles Insider blog by "solving" posted issues (proposed article ideas) through pull requests. If your PR is merged, you will be compensated.

## Writing Guidelines

Articles and guides should be saved in their respective folders, `articles` or `guides`, following the naming convention `YYYYMMDD_title_of_the_article.md`.

Articles should be at least 1500 words and follow Draft.devâ€™s excellent [style guide](https://draft.dev/learn/styleguide).

### Writing Structure
- **Headings**: Use H2 subtitles to structure your content, ensuring each article has several to facilitate the TOC.
- **Formatting**:
  - Use **bold**, *italic*, and _underline_ for emphasis.
  - Include `code elements` where necessary.
  - Add links on important keywords.
  - Use notes, quotes, TLDR sections (short bullet lists), and key points to enhance readability.
- **Introduction**: Always start with at least two paragraphs for the introduction before the first H2 section.

### Assets
- **Storage**: Save all images in the `/assets` folder.
- **Naming**: Name images the same as the article with an extra suffix, e.g., `YYYYMMDD_title_of_the_article_img1.png`.
- **Placement**: Do not embed images directly in the article; link to them from the `/assets` folder.

### Fact Check
ALWAYS ensure your information is accurate and up-to-date.

### Interlinking
Link relevant keywords to the following pages for definitions or related content:
- [Daytona Dotfiles Sitemap](https://www.daytona.io/sitemap-dotfiles.xml)
- [Daytona Definitions Sitemap](https://www.daytona.io/sitemap-definitions.xml)

### Glossary/Definitions
If you encounter a new term that could be added to Daytona Definitions page, mark it in the article and add a comment with a one-line description.

### Notes
Aim for long-lasting and evergreen content. Avoid mentioning specific versions of technology that may soon become outdated.

### Editing Process
Your article will go through up to two rounds of editing:
- We suggest reading your article out loud and running it through [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).
- Authors will need to respond to edits and update the article accordingly.
- Articles not meeting our standards will not be published.

### Get Published
Once approved, we will inform you of the publication date.

### Get Paid
Upon acceptance:
- You will be paid directly or through bounties in case one was assigned to the issue.

To get paid, send us an invoice including:
- Date, Title of Article, Amount.
- Payment details such as: Bank Name, Account Number/IBAN, Routing Number/SWIFT Code/ABA.
